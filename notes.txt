Basic algorithm may be working.  See no_alpha.png and alpha.png.  Note
that the alpha "hump" may not be completely knocked down because part
of the new alpha-inflicted colors may be left over from the previous
window.  If you look at the updated diff plot, it seems to be doing a
decent job of eliminating the alpha effect.

Now we just need to either apply it as we go, or try to figure out
what the alpha value is and apply it after the initial scan.

We might be close to done if we went with the interactive "eraser" and
allowed the opacity to be tweaked manually.
